title: Being Wrong

# {{ page.title }}

More and more, I've been realizing that one single fear has been
holding me back: being wrong. In order to avoid being wrong, I end up
not speaking up, not voicing my opinion, and not being noticed.

This blog is about facing that fear. I'm ready to be wrong.
