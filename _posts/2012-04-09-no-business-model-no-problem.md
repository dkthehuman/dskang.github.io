title: No Business Model? No Problem.

[Facebook's acquisition of Instagram](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/09/facebook-to-acquire-instagram-for-1-billion/?grcc=33333Z98ZtrendingZ0)
for $1 billion today reminded me of
[LinkedIn's acquisition of Rapportive](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/07/linkedin-picks-up-rapportive-for-around-15-million/)
for around $15 million a couple months back.

Neither product had any revenue, and yet they were both successful.
I've heard many times before that it doesn't matter if you don't know
how you're going to make money from your product. I always thought
that was silly; of course you have to keep money in mind! But these
deals show that gaining traction and winning users over is absolutely
the most important thing in today's market. It didn't matter that
Instagram had $0 in revenue -- what mattered was that their users
loved the product, and that there were millions of them. It really is
all about the product.
